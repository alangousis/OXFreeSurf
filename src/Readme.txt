Before executing the open-source code of OX FreeSurf, the user should first download and install an open-source Python release (version 3.7 or higher), 
which runs smoothly (i.e. not encountering malfunctions/bugs; check for maintenance status at python.org/downloads). 
After successful installation of Python, the user should also install: a) the tkinter python package, which binds Python to the open-source
Tk graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit, b) the pandas and numpy libraries which allow for analysis of arrays, c) the matplotlib library: one of Pythonâ€™s 
basic plotting tools providing an application programming interface (API) to embed plots into tkinter, and d) the modules sys, time and os, which manipulate 
the runtime environment, synchronize the execution of codes, and interact with the operating system, respectively.

Execution of the open-source code proceeds by running ox_gui.pyw from Python's command window.
